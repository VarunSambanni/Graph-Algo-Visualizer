# Graph-Algo-Visualizer
DFS, BFS Visualizer <br/>
[Link to the Visualizer](https://graph-algo-visualizer-lat.netlify.app/)  
A ReactJS application to visualize graph traversal algorithms-Breadth First Search(BFS), Depth First Search(DFS), and BiDirectional BFS on a 2D grid. Each cell is a node, and the traversal can be done in top, down, left, right directions only.

The app also finds the shortest path, and the minimum distance between source and the destination nodes, as well as the distance itself.

The app also allows the user to add blocks, through which traversal is not possible, instead of using the randomize option.
